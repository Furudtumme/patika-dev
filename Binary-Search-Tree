First of all, I chose burds root 5. Being in the middle made it easier for me.
Then i placed the larger than 5 on the right and the smaller ones on the left.


                                  5
                                /   \
                              3       6
                             / \       \
                            1   4       8
                           / \         / \
                          0   2       7   9
