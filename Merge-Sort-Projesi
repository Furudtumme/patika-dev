First, we split the array in half.
[16,21,11] [8,12,22]
Then we slipt array again. The results like that:
[16,21] [11] [8,12] [22]
We arrange the parts among themselves.
[16,21] [11] [8,12] [22] (Actually, it's not really necessary.)

Finally, we concatenate all the arrays and sort them.
[8,11,12,16,21,22]

Voil√†!
